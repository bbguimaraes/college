An implementation of the ["tablut"][wikipedia_tablut] game (with slightly
simpler rules, e.g. no base camps). The original code is from a programming
assignment. It has been heavily refactored and "ported" from c++ and conio.h to
ANSI C and ncurses, but the original logic is pretty much intact
(surprisingly).

The compilation process is simple and the Makefile is self-explanatory. It
should compile on any unix-like machine and the only external dependency is
`ncurses`.

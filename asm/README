A little assembly project from the computer architecture class. The program
reads a three-digit number and "slides" it to the bottom of the column and then
to an external three-digit seven-segments display. After that, it is multiplied
by three and moved a column to the right. When the fourth column is done, the
program ends.

The procedure to display the number of the external display is implemented as
an interruption. The cs:ip values are written to the interrupt vector table for
the `6eh` interrupt, which is then called on the main loop. The display is
programmed by writing the value `80h` to the `0303h` address.

The main part of the program can be tested using dosbox. I didn't figure out if
there's a way to test the external display part. To compile, link and execute
the code using MASM:

    $ dosbox run.bat
